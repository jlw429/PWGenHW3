This is a password generator using basic JS from what we have learned so far. I used alot of Mozilla developers to help with some new commands such as .fromCharCode . 

It has provided me a few sleepless nights (along with some bashing my head on the desk) to understand JS. This project has helped immensly in that arena.

All bugs have been ironed out. 

Also added alot more comments in my code. It really helped build the framework!
